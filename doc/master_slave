- Receptionist
	- Rails server.
	- Central gatekeeper for the whole damn shindig.

 - Server begins streaming events since last time

__ Auth lifecycle __
auth event -> 'local' node
if local node == resource node

__ Remote Auth __
auth event -> upstream
upstream sends Utilization to all downstream nodes (unreliably)

__ Database sync __
Use MySQL master/slave. No, seriously, this makes it easy.
